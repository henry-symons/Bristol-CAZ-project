# Bristol-CAZ-project

Bristol City Council introduced a clean air zone (CAZ), where certain types of vehicles were charged a daily fee to enter a specified area around the city centre, in November 2022 to attempt to meet government guidance on air quality.

In this project I investigate the success of this scheme in achieving these aims.

To quantify air quality, we examine the concentration of NO2 from momnitoring sites across Bristol in data made publicly available by Bristol City Council. As a guideline, government policy states that the annual mean concentration cannot legally exceed 40 Î¼g/m3.


To reproduce the analysis in this project, download the specified datasets and place within a folder titled 'data' in the same directory as the Python notebook.
